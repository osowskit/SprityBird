## Skillz example instructions

This project is setup to work with the latest version of the Skillz iOS SDK, which can be found at [https://skillz.com/developer/downloads](https://skillz.com/developer/downloads).

Once the SDK is downloaded, the Skillz embedded framework will need to be added to the project. For additional SDK installation details refer to the [Skillz documentation](https://skillz.com/developer/docs/install_framework_ios).
